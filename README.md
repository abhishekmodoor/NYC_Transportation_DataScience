# NYC_Transportation_DataScience

This project performs an analysis on NYC transportation. We determine areas of NYC which has sparse and large amounts of transportation (from taxis), and determine which areas would benefit from other forms of transportation (subways, buses, etc.) in order to alleviate traffic and length of travel for the rider.
